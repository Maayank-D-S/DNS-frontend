Unlike traditional 2D drawings, a BIM model contains rich information about each component of the building – not just its geometry, but also details like materials, specifications, and performance data. Multiple disciplines (architecture, structure, MEP, etc.) contribute to one cohesive model, which makes collaboration much more efficient. With BIM, potential conflicts (for example, a pipe running into a beam) can be detected and resolved virtually before construction, saving time and cost. Additionally, BIM can integrate project timeline (4D scheduling) and cost (5D estimation) information, providing a comprehensive platform for planning, designing, constructing, and managing a facility.",

with low environmental impact and designing high-performance building envelopes (walls, roofs,
insulation, windows) that reduce energy loss. Energy efficiency is a key goal: systems like HVAC and
lighting are designed to consume less power by using efficient equipment and controls, while
renewable energy sources (like solar panels) may be incorporated to further reduce the building’s
carbon footprint. In addition, green building design considers water conservation, waste reduction,
